# Coding Quiz

## Overview

This application is a timed quiz that the user can use to test their knowledge on the topics of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Usage

Upon pressing the Start button, the user is presented with the first question on the quiz and a countdown timer starting at 30 seconds begins. If the question is answered correctly, 3 seconds are added onto the timer. If the question is answered incorrectly, 3 seconds will be subtracted from the timer. The end score is how many seconds remain on the countdown timer. When the quiz is finished the user will be prompted to submit their initials to add their score to a comparative list of other user's scores.
